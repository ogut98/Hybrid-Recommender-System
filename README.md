# Hybrid Recommender System

This project implements a Hybrid Recommender System using a combination of item-based and user-based recommendation techniques. The system predicts movie recommendations for a given user by leveraging collaborative filtering and correlation analysis.

## Techniques Used

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering methods to generate recommendations.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Calculates correlations between users and items to identify similar users and movies.
- **Pivot Tables:** Creates a user-movie matrix for efficient data representation.
- **Weighted Average:** Computes a weighted average recommendation score based on user correlations and ratings.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development and analysis environment.
